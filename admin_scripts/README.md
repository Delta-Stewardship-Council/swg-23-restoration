## Introduction

This directory is intended to keep scripts that will be used frequently in the project. It is not for any specific task (eg. scraping files from the internet, running spatial analyses, etc). In other words, these are scripts to help automate and administrate tasks within this github project.

## Scripts

* load_paths.R - Intended to load relevant paths to home directory (for this github) and path to data on Box.
