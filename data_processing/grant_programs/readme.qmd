```{r}

# Load path to cloud directory
source("admin_scripts/init_load_paths.R")

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(sf)

# create path to grant program coordinates directory
pth$gpc <- file.path(pth$data, "grant_program_coordinates")

# raw data
pth$raw <- file.path(pth$gpc, "raw")
```

## Directory Listing

In this directory, you'll find the script `creating_spatial_db.R`. This takes the various data files in box > grant_program_coordinates, and creates a geopackage with layers corresponding to each dataset. The description of the files in this box directory is found in the README.md there.

You'll also find the `spatial_filtering.R` script which yields a table that indicates which objects are within our spatial boundary.
