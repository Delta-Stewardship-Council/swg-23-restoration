# create path to grant program coordinates directory
pth$gpc <- file.path(pth$data, "grant_program_coordinates")

# raw data
pth$raw <- file.path(pth$gpc, "raw")
```

## Directory Listing

The description of the files in box > data > grant_program_coordinates > raw directory is found in the README.md there.

In this directory, you'll find the script `gpc1_creating_spatial_db.R`. This takes the various raw data files, and creates a geopackage with layers corresponding to each dataset. 

You'll also find the `gpc2_spatial_filtering.R` script which yields a table that indicates which objects are within our spatial boundary.

The `gpc3_criteria.R` script filters all the data based on criteria we've outlined in an xlsx document.
